# Ng-Spring-Security

This project is oriented around developing a JWT authentication strategy for authenticating users with Spring. Ideally it will utilize Spring Security, and store/compar 256-bit encrypted passwords. The purpose is to develop a JWT based authentication for a RESTful service to use in conjunction with AngularJS (1.5). This project will also employ Angular `components`, JPA, MySQL, and Angular's `$resource` service.
